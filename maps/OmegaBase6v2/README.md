This is probably the most exaggerated map I have ever created. 
My recommendations for the game are: Team A (0,1,2,3,4,5) VS Team B (6,7). 
Team A has: Medium Oil, Medium-High Defenses, while Team B has Insane Oil, Extreme Defenses.

If you play with bots then you can win as a Team A or B, 
I don't know how it would be in multiplayer, but I have never had the opportunity to try it.
