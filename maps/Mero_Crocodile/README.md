Hello Gentlemen,

I believe I dont have to say why it is called Crocodile.

The bases here have 14x14 tiles areas, so very small. 4 oils per player. Basic structures in minimal amount with two machineguard towers at the gate. I have left some place if 10 player version was needed.

Have fun,

Regards,
