- Pumpkin Studios, whose employees were the authors of the two original maps that I used to create this map: **Sk-4c-Basingstoke** and **Sk-8c-ThePit**. I was inspired by both of these maps, each of which has slightly different concepts that I wanted to mash together into a single 8-player map. I outright copied-and-pasted significant portions of both of these Pumpkin Studios maps to create a much larger map that I named: **8c-MountainKing** ... and then I manually reworked and manually re-tiled 80% of the **8c-MountainKing** map anyway!

Map Attributes:
- **Type:** Skirmish / Multiplayer
- **Design:** Symmetrical, Land only
- **Tile Set:** Rocky Mountains
- **Size:** 249 x 249, which was largest I could make it in Flame v1.28.
- **Aesthetics and Features:**
  - This map utilizes complex usage of terrain elevations and painstaking application of the Rocky Mountain tile set to try to create an immersive impression that you are fighting up in the snow-capped Rocky Mountains, near and old NORAD airbase at the top of a large mountain. I spent a great deal of time on attention to detail with the visuals. I'm not 100% done with the aesthetics at the time of sharing in this thread. However, I want feedback from other players before I make further changes. This map offers different strategic areas outside the player bases that are designed to be heavily contested that players and AI can fight over. Some areas will change hands several times per game.
- **Resource Level:** Medium—there are 162 total oil resources for 8 players (plus optional Scavengers) to fight over.
  - 80 reside in the rear of 8 player bases, which are the easiest to defend—10 per base.
  - 16 reside outside the main entrances to player bases, which are more vulnerable to attack—2 per base.
  - 32 reside approximately halfway between any two adjacent player bases in small areas that are easily accessible from 3 different compass points—4 per area. These areas are where you will primarily: scout, claim resources, and fight to maintain control—and they tend to change hands frequently.
  - 34 are dispersed across **The Mountain** located at the center of the map, which is made up of several plateaus. The various plateaus are connected by several trails that lead from the lowlands up to an old NORAD airbase at the summit. Oil resources on the lowest plateau are much more spread out but they become more densely populated the higher elevation you are at, making the summit a significantly strategic location.
- **Scavengers:** Should you enable them, the Scavenger faction will have a full-fledged base on the summit of The Mountain, where an old NORAD airbase is located. Initially, Scavengers will control and utilize all oil resources on **The Mountain**, and they have placed defenses along each mountain trail that approaches their main base at the summit. The Scavengers are as well dug-in and defended as they can be, which makes it a significant risk to prioritize capturing their summit base in order to exploit its resources in the early game ahead of conquering your neighboring enemies!
