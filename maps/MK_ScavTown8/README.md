Oil: low (10 in players bases)
Recommended start settings: Ultimate Scavengers + Advanced bases + Technology from T1

The Scavengers have many "High End Weapons": Scourge- and Pulse Laser Hardpoint,  Missile- and Mass Driver Fortress and some ranged weapons: Ripple Rocket, Hellstorm- and Archangel-Emplacement with CB-Towers in the middle of the map. I have only tested in single player skirmish. You can play in team or alone against all (at first no direct neighbors come by, except with hover).

8 player-version: 4 vs 4, All vs All, ...
- 10x oil per Player: 6x safe oil in base, 4x UNSAFE oil near the base
- 96x oil by Scavs: 8x4 Oil in "little" bases + 8x4 Oil in centre + 2x16 in left & right bases = 96
(this map is also available as an 10 player version)
