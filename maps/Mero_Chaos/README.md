Hello gentlemen  

The map is called Chaos because it is in fact at least a little chaotic  

If you take a closer look you will notice it is made of sixteen identical elements  but.. rotated.. so.. it create a little landscape and terrain chaos  

The map is for 8 players, advanced bases included, 2 oil in base.. or even 1, it depend on the point of view  and another 8/9 on the map per player  

Have Fun  

Bye
