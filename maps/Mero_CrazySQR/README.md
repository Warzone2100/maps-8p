Hello Gentlemen  

Crazy SQR "Squared" is yet another Squared variation. I have called is Crazy, because it uses some additional terrain space, normally not used by a typical Squared map.

The map is of course for eight players. I wanted it to be lesser in power, as a result you have 14 oils per player, one of which is accessible only by transport "VTOL". Advanced bases are included, but not in their full power, by that I mean you will have to build rest of the necessary structures. Each base has basic protection, but do not count on it for too long. Gateways are included. The map is 180x180.

Have fun
