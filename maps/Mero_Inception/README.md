Hello Gentlemen  

How are the maps being played? any support? opinion?  

I am happy to present the Inception map. It is called inception as it constantly creates from its centre   maybe one day the 12 players version?   

The map is for eight players. 200x200. Advanced bases with basic defence including SAM AA are included. And gateways of course. 21,5 oils per player. 10 oils in exact base.

And here goes the very important part.

!!!text!!! On no account players 4, 5 and then 6, 7 can be placed next to each other while in opposite teams and when advanced bases are turned on. Even if the advanced bases are off, the same players placement is not recommended but possible. But it is a little bit insane then, yet still possible. If you will insist on placing separate players on the "island" then at least place them at the opposite corners and only two of them.

The map is intended for battles between those outside with those inside the map, and that is why the map has specific base numbering. It proved to be quite good for games between good players with beginning players, it is you who will decide who go where in such games depending on your game aim.!!!text!!! 

Of course you will use it as you wish, but you have been advised  

The map is very good for team wars and learning cooperation on both sides.

Have fun
