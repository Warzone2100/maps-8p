This modification on the classic NTW map encourages more aggressive play and shorter games. It moves 10 oils from each base to the middle of the map, where players must fight for control.

In the classic NTW map, passive players can hide in their base without consequence. In this modified map, players will be at an oil disadvantage unless they go out and fight.

Games will be shorter because the team who controls the middle of the map will have an oil advantage. They can overpower their opponent more quickly.

To discourage truck rushes, scavengers are optionally available. They defend the middle oils with a few machinegun bunkers.
